-- This file is an initialization script to seed the database with its default values
-- It is automatically loaded and mounted on initial docker compose

-- Examples:

-- CREATE TABLE courses (
--   subject_abbreviation_with_number text PRIMARY KEY,
--   title text NOT NULL,
--   cumulative_gpa decimal NULL,
--   credits text NULL,
--   AND SO ON...
--  );

-- You can then insert multiple records into the table here
-- Additionally, you can install extensions (like pg_trgm for trigrams), as well as build indexes for fast full text searching
